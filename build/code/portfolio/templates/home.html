    <h3>Web Application Security</h3>
    <p>Have your web application or API tested in a variety of forms - DAST, SAST, and penetration testing.  I will walk you through existing issues and empower developers to prevent them going forward.</p>
    <h3>Docker Container Security</h3>
    <p>Docker offers nice functionality and features, but can be easily misconfigured.  I will analyze OS vulnerabilities, package vulnerabilities, permission misconfiguration, secret storage, network communication, logging, monitoring, and much more.
    <h3>Network/Infrastructure Security</h3>
    <p>I will analyze your entire network architecture for flaws or conduct a full penetration test on your business.  Misconfiguration of security gateways, mail servers, and insecure data storage can lead to loss of revenue.</p>
